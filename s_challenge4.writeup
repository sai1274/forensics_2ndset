I tried opening the image it's fine.
So i gone through meta data of the file using the command "exiftool s_challenge4.png"

This prints all the meta data of the png in the comments section i found this 
"5a6d78685a33746f4e474e724d334a7a587a52794d31387a646a4e796558646f4d33497a66513d3d"

this is in hex encoded form. 

So i decoded it using the command 
print "5a6d78685a33746f4e474e724d334a7a587a52794d31387a646a4e796558646f4d33497a66513d3d".decode('hex')

Then i got this "ZmxhZ3toNGNrM3JzXzRyM18zdjNyeXdoM3IzfQ=="

it is a cipher text which is encoded under base64 you can decode it with the command :

print "ZmxhZ3toNGNrM3JzXzRyM18zdjNyeXdoM3IzfQ==".decode('base64')

then i got the flag:

"flag{h4ck3rs_4r3_3v3rywh3r3}"
