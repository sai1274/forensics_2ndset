Initially i tried to conert the file into an executable file and try reverse enginering using the
command "chmod +x <filename>"
but no use Then i gave the command 

		"strings revers.me | grep -i 'inctf'"

i didn't get any results then i gave the command 

		"strings revers.me | grep -i '{'" 

Then i manually gone through the output i found it :  

		"*}ss3ug_1_gn1sr3ver_t4_d00g_3ra_u0Y{ftcn"

On reversing this we get inctf{Y0u_ar3_g00d_4t_rev3rs1ng_1_gu3ss}
it's it the flag format.
