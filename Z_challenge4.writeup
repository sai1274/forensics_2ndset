On opening the image we can see a barcode.

So i tried using the tool Zbarimg it is a tool which is used to scan and decode QR codes from image
files 

it can be installed using the command "sudo apt-get install zbar-tools"

usage "zbarimg <filename>"

On rrunning the above command i got the flag : "flag{g00d_j0b_g33ks!!}"
