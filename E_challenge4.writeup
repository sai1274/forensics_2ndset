I tried opening the image it opened then i though there are no chunk errors. So i though to look into
the meta data of the image then in the comment section i found this :
"Njk2ZTYzNzQ2NjdiNzkzMDc1NWY2NzMwNzQ1ZjM3NjgzMzVmNjY2YzM0Njc3ZA=="

This looks as a cipher text and encoded under base64 so i used the command 

print "Njk2ZTYzNzQ2NjdiNzkzMDc1NWY2NzMwNzQ1ZjM3NjgzMzVmNjY2YzM0Njc3ZA==".decode('bas64')


Then i got this cipher text:
"696e6374667b7930755f6730745f3768335f666c34677d"

this cipher text is in the form of hex so i ran the command :

print "696e6374667b7930755f6730745f3768335f666c34677d".decode('hex')

Then i got the flag: inctf{y0u_g0t_7h3_fl4g}
